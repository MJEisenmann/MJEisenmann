<h1>Hi, I'm Melissa!</h1> 

<h2><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meisenmann/">Former email campaign developer</a> looking to redirect my career towards a more data&#8209;heavy role with coding, probably as a data&nbsp;analyst.</h2>

<h2>Background:</h2>

I worked 13 1/2 years in email campaign development until I was laid off in March 2024 as part of a restructuring of the Sales and Marketing teams. Though I did love the operations side of setting up campaigns (e.g., identifying the audience, writing the code and/or building the flowcharts to process those records, writing the code to pull the reporting results), I wasn't getting to write that kind of code as much anymore. Simply put, I missed writing SQL code and this layoff was my chance to get a job where I could write more code. 
<br/><br/>
I don't have the type of SQL experience or knowledge to be an actual SQL Developer but I do have it to be a Data Analyst. However, there are other technologies that Data Analysts use these days. I need to learn them and I need to demonstrate that. I am going to use Git and GitHub to do that.


<h2>üöß Post-Layoff Projects for Professional Development:</h2>

- <b>Python</b>
  - French noun gender flashcard program - GitHub repo link coming soon
  - TBD


<h2> üî≠ Programs & Technology I Plan to Learn: </h2>

- <b>Tableau</b>: I've only used Tableau Reader <br/>
- <b>Power BI</b>: I've only set up extracts to go to a Power BI set-up
- <b>Markdown</b>: I already know traditional HTML but Markdown is just different enough. However, creating ReadMe files for GitHub will definitely help me.


<h2> üå± Programs & Technology I Have Recently Begun to Learn: </h2>

- <b>Python</b>: I've been introduced to it so it's time to practice that knowledge with some more projects so that I can add this to the Skills section on my resume.
- <b>Git</b> and <b>GitHub</b>: Admittedly, this is even newer to me, but as I develop projects with other technologies, this will be where I share that work and concurrently improve my git skills.


<h2> üë©‚Äçüíª Programs & Technology I Already Know:</h2>

- <b>SQL</b>: I learned PL/SQL first and then SQL Server. The latter is what I've used more in the past few years. I have minimal experience with Redshift. My experience with all of them has primarily been in writing queries, importing and exporting data, etc.
- <b>Microsoft Office</b>: Excel is my favorite product in the Office Suite but I've used the rest of them including PowerPoint, SharePoint, SharePoint Designer, and Access.
- <b>HTML</b>: My comfort level with CSS could use some bolstering but I've spent a lot of time with HTML over the past few years while working on emails.


<h2> ‚ö° More Random Things About Me:</h2>

- üòÑ Pronouns: she/her
- üåª I am a proud graduate of Randolph-Macon Woman's College and I am an Even. (This will make sense to other R-MWC/RC students and alumni.)
- üê± My cat is named Cleo. She is an 18-year-old, long-haired Calico fluff ball with an attitude. (She is a cat after all.) She is usually my profile pic across social media.
- üß∂ I love to knit, cross-stitch, and quilt. I alternate between them, often based on the weather. Sometimes it is too hot to knit.
- üëΩ I am a PC gamer. Though I normally prefer simulator games (The Sims, Cities: Skylines, etc.) as they don't activate my motion sickness, I have a deep love for Alien: Isolation. I have played through it 9 times as of June 17, 2024 across all difficulty levels. I've gotten 100% of the achievements. I've even been doing some very casual speedrunning of it lately. I'm more focused on improving my own times as opposed to the actually-running-through-most-of-the-game official speedrunning styles. More power to those people but that's too much camera movement for me.
